Test Case Number ,Test Case Name,Test Case Description,Expected Input in string,Expected Output in string,,,
1,"Generate soundex code for a string which consist of occurances of a, e, i, o, u, y, h, w ","This test case takes an input, drops the occurances of a, e, i, o, u, y, h, w and replaces all consonents with numbers and returns soundex code as a output",Robert,R163,,,
2,Generate soundex code for the string with letters having same number that are adjacent,"This test case takes an input and if two or more letters with the same number are adjacent, it only retain the first letter's soundex and returns soundex as a output",Rubbbbin,R150,,,
3,"Generate soundex code for the string with letters having same number are separated by 'h', 'w' or 'y'","This test case takes an input and if two letters with the same number separated by 'h', 'w' or 'y', then it will be coded as a single number and returns soundex as a output",Ashcraft,A261,,,
4,Generate soundex code for the string with letters having same number are separated by vowel,"This test case takes an input and if two letters with the same number separated by vowel, then it will be coded twice and returns soundex as a output",Tymczak,T522,,,
5,Generate soundex code for the string with first two letters having same number.,This test case takes an input and verifies if first two letters have the same number then it will be  coded once as single letter and returns soundex as a output,Pfister,P236,,,
6,Generate soundex code for the string which has soundex code less than 4,"This test case takes an input, generates soundex and verifies the whether soundex length is four. if not, it appends remaining zeros and returns soundex with length four as a output",Rubin,R150,,,
7,Generate soundex for the empty string.,"This test case takes an input and verifies whether it is empty. If yes, then it returns empty string as output","""""","""""",,,
